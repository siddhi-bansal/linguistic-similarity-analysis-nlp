This project analyzes cross-lingual semantic similarity by comparing three state-of-the-art embedding models (LASER, LaBSE, and OpenAI) across 61 languages including English, Chinese, Arabic, French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and many others, examining different sentence complexity types. The analysis includes comprehensive visualizations such as heatmaps and word clouds to understand how different languages relate to each other semantically, with particular focus on how sentence complexity affects cross-lingual similarity patterns.

## Visualization Details  

The repository contains visualizations organized under the [`/laser`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/laser), [`/labse`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/labse), and [`/openai`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/openai) directories.  

### Heatmaps  
Located in the `/heatmaps` subdirectory [`laser heatmaps`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/laser/heatmaps), [`labse heatmaps`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/labse/heatmaps), [`openai heatmaps`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/openai/heatmaps)), these visualizations display cosine similarities across all sentences (not binned).  
- Each heatmap compares one language to a baseline language (specified in the file title).  
- The `all_languages_similarity_heatmap.png` provides an overview of universal similarity across all languages and sentences.  

### Word Clouds  
Available in the `/wordclouds` subdirectory [`laser wordclouds`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/laser/wordclouds), [`labse wordclouds`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/labse/wordclouds), [`openai wordclouds`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/openai/wordclouds), these word clouds depict cosine similarities between each language and all other languages.  

### Sentence Complexity Analysis (LASER Model)  
We performed clustering of heatmaps and word clouds based on sentence types (simple, complex, and compound) specifically for the LASER model, our baseline. These are located in the 
[`/laser/complexity_and_similarity`](https://github.com/siddhi-bansal/NLP-Semantics-Final-Project/tree/main/laser/complexity_and_similarity) directory.  
- The `all_similarities_heatmap.png` highlights universally similar languages, focusing on specific sentence complexity categories (simple, compound, or complex).  
- The word clouds here represent cosine similarities of languages, restricted to sentences of the same complexity category.
